Issue log:

 - broadcasting error with M>1
   - change N,M,1,1 to N,M,1
 - mismatch in strategy length
   - change M,1,1 to M,1 to match previous change
 - ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 1 dimension(s) and the array at index 4 has 0 dimension(s)
   - Need to output grad_e_W_p and similar instead of grad_e_W_p[0] now that they have reduced dimension due to previous changes
 - UnboundLocalError: local variable 'mu' referenced before assignment
   - was an issue with the optimization, though may also be because of failure to import scipy package
 - cycling in strategy optimization
   - switched to strategies that can be positive or negative in each components (rather than having those separated)

Debuggging strategy optimization:


Case 1: works now
Seed = 0,
Dg_dF = 0.04
De_dg = -0.8257414
di_dK_p = 1.88933783
di_dK_n = 1.04369664
Cycles between K+ and K- (perhaps because exponent parameters are similar). Should be K-.

Case 2:
Seed = 1
dg_dF = 0.8346096
de_dg = 0.34093502
di_dK_p = 0.07810957
di_dK_n = 0.33966084
[ 0.45066286,  0.        , -0.        , -0.54933714,  0.        ]
K should be positive I think

Case 3:
Seed = 2
dg_dF = 0.36887973
de_dg = 0.02715624
di_dK_p = 1.19349062
di_dK_n = 0.452024
[ 0.,  0.,  0., -1.,  0.]
K should be positive

Case 4:
Seed = 3
dg_dF = 0.51850489
de_dg = 0.11770818
di_dK_p = 1.8727673
di_dK_n = 1.95199084
[-0., -0.,  0., -1.,  0.]
K should be positive

Case 5:
Seed = 4
dg_dF = 1.96680135
de_dg = 0.72598647
di_dK_p = 0.34633084
di_dK_n = 0.14989717
[-0., -0.,  0., -1.,  0.]
K should be positive

Case 6:
Seed = 5
dg_dF = 0.54817292
de_dg = 0.75987406
di_dK_p = 0.33122572
di_dK_n = 1.92786106
[-0., -0.,  0., -1.,  0.]
K should be positive
